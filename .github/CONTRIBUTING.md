## Coding Standards

This project follows the [Laravel PHP Guidelines](laravel-php-guidelines.md) and [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.

### Key Guidelines

- **Follow Laravel conventions** first
- **Use typed properties** over docblocks
- **Prefer early returns** over nested conditions
- **Use constructor property promotion** when possible
- **Always use curly braces** for control structures
- **Use string interpolation** over concatenation

### Code Style

We use [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) for code formatting:

```bash
composer format
```

### Static Analysis

We use [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis:

```bash
composer analyse
```

## Documentation

When contributing, please update documentation as needed:

- **Update README.md** for new features or changes
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- **Add PHPDoc blocks** for new public methods
- **Update configuration documentation** if config changes

## Architecture Guidelines

### Models and Traits

- **Models** should be focused and follow single responsibility
- **Traits** should be composable and well-documented
- **Use polymorphic relationships** appropriately
- **Follow Eloquent conventions** for relationships

### Actions

- **Actions** should be single-purpose classes
- **Use database transactions** for complex operations
- **Emit events** for important lifecycle changes
- **Handle exceptions** gracefully

### Events

- **Events** should be descriptive and carry necessary data
- **Use past tense** for completed actions (`BookingCompleted`)
- **Use present continuous** for ongoing actions (`BookingInProgress`)

### Tests

- **Feature tests** for end-to-end scenarios
- **Unit tests** for isolated components
- **Use factories** for test data
- **Follow arrange-act-assert** pattern

## Database Guidelines

### Migrations

- **Use descriptive names** for migrations
- **Only use `up()` methods** (no down methods)
- **Test migrations** with fresh database
- **Consider backward compatibility**

### Schema Design

- **Use appropriate column types**
- **Add proper indexes** for performance
- **Use foreign key constraints** where appropriate
- **Consider nullable columns** carefully

## Performance Considerations

- **Use eager loading** to prevent N+1 queries
- **Add database indexes** for commonly queried columns
- **Optimize complex queries** with proper joins
- **Consider caching** for expensive operations

## Security Guidelines

- **Validate all inputs** properly
- **Use parameter binding** for database queries
- **Follow Laravel security practices**
- **Don't expose sensitive data** in logs or responses

## Version Compatibility

- **Maintain backward compatibility** within major versions
- **Document breaking changes** in CHANGELOG
- **Follow semantic versioning** (SemVer)
- **Test against supported PHP/Laravel versions**
